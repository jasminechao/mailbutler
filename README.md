## Objective

Coding Challenge: I was tasked to create a web application, that would render a landing page according to the wireframe below.
It was important that the landing page web application get the content for each building block of the final website from a simple database. This would allow any content marketing person to easily setup another landing page, just by adding the corresponding content to the database and the web app would make sure that the new landing page is rendered accordingly.
